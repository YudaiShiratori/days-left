## Issue Creation Workflow

Based on your description: **"$ARGUMENTS"**, I'll help you choose the most appropriate issue type and template.

### Step 2: Choose Issue Type

For reporting bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior:
```bash
gh issue create --template bug_report.yml --title "$ARGUMENTS"
```

#### ‚ú® Feature Request  
For requesting new features or enhancements:
```bash
gh issue create --template feature_request.yml --title "$ARGUMENTS"
```

#### üìö Documentation
For documentation improvements or issues:
```bash

```

```

### Step 3: Enhance Issue Metadata

After creating the issue, enhance it with proper metadata:

```bash
# Get the issue number from the previous command
ISSUE_NUMBER=$(gh issue list --limit 1 --json number --jq '.[0].number')

# Assign to yourself
gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUMBER --add-assignee @me

# Add appropriate labels based on issue type
gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUMBER --add-label "priority:medium"

# Add to project board (if applicable)
# gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUMBER --add-project "Project Name"

# Set milestone (if applicable)  
# gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUMBER --milestone "v1.2.0"
```

### Step 4: Link to Development Workflow

Once your issue is created, you can begin development:

```bash
# Start working on the issue immediately
/project:work-on-issue $ISSUE_NUMBER
```

## Issue Quality Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Good Issue Titles
- **Specific**: "Login button doesn't work on mobile Safari"

- **Clear**: "Update installation docs for Windows users"

### ‚ùå Poor Issue Titles

- **Too broad**: "Improve the app"
- **Unclear**: "Fix stuff"
