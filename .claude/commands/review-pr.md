- CI Checks: !`gh pr checks $ARGUMENTS`
- Changed Files: !`gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS --name-only`

## Comprehensive Review Process

Think carefully about this Pull Request and conduct a thorough review following these systematic steps.

### Step 1: Initial Assessment

#### 1.1 Gather PR Information
```bash
# Get comprehensive PR details
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --comments

# Check PR metadata
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,labels,assignees,reviewRequests

# Review the diff summary
gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS --stat
```

#### 1.2 Understand the Context
```bash
# Check related issues
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json body | jq -r '.body' | grep -E "#[0-9]+"

# Review recent commits
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json commits | jq -r '.commits[].messageHeadline'

# Check branch comparison
gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS --name-only
```

### Step 2: Code Quality Analysis

#### 2.1 Review Changed Files
Examine each changed file systematically using file references:

```bash
# Get list of changed files
CHANGED_FILES=$(gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS --name-only)

# Review each file (use @ syntax to examine files)
echo "Files to review:"
echo "$CHANGED_FILES"
```

For each file, consider:
- **Code Structure**: Is the code well-organized and readable?
- **Logic**: Are algorithms and business logic correct?
- **Error Handling**: Are errors properly caught and handled?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
- **Security**: Are there potential security vulnerabilities?

#### 2.2 Check Code Standards Compliance
```bash
# Clone PR branch for local testing (if needed)
gh pr checkout $ARGUMENTS

# Run quality checks on the PR branch
bun run check
bun run type-check
bun run test

# Return to original branch
git checkout -
```

### Step 3: Functional Review

#### 3.1 Test the Changes
```bash
# If you checked out the PR branch, test functionality
# bun run dev
# bun run test -- --grep "relevant tests"

# Check if new tests were added
gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS | grep -E "\+.*test|spec"

# Verify test coverage
# bun run test:coverage
```

#### 3.2 Verify Requirements
Review against the PR description and linked issues:
- [ ] Does the implementation match the requirements?
- [ ] Are all acceptance criteria met?
- [ ] Are edge cases properly handled?
- [ ] Is the user experience intuitive?

### Step 4: Architecture and Design Review

#### 4.1 Assess Design Decisions
- **Consistency**: Does the code follow existing patterns?
- **Maintainability**: Will this code be easy to maintain?
- **Extensibility**: Is the design flexible for future changes?
- **Dependencies**: Are new dependencies justified?

#### 4.2 Check Integration Points
- **API Changes**: Are API changes backward compatible?
- **Database Changes**: Are migrations safe and reversible?
- **UI Changes**: Do UI changes follow design guidelines?
- **Performance Impact**: Will changes affect system performance?

### Step 5: Security and Best Practices

#### 5.1 Security Review
- **Input Validation**: Are all inputs properly validated?
- **Authentication**: Are auth checks in place where needed?
- **Authorization**: Are permission checks correct?
- **Data Exposure**: Is sensitive data properly protected?
- **XSS/CSRF**: Are web vulnerabilities addressed?

#### 5.2 Best Practices Check
- **TypeScript**: Are types comprehensive and accurate?
- **React**: Are React best practices followed?
- **Performance**: Are there unnecessary re-renders or computations?
- **Accessibility**: Are accessibility requirements met?

### Step 6: Documentation and Communication

#### 6.1 Review Documentation
- **Code Comments**: Are complex sections well-commented?
- **API Documentation**: Is API documentation updated?
- **README Updates**: Are user-facing changes documented?
- **Migration Guides**: Are breaking changes documented?

#### 6.2 Check Commit Quality
```bash
# Review commit messages
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json commits | jq -r '.commits[] | "\(.messageHeadline)\n\(.messageBody)"'

# Check for clean history
gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS --stat
```
