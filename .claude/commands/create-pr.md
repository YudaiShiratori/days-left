# Create Pull Request from Current Changes: $ARGUMENTS

Create a comprehensive Pull Request from your current working changes with automated analysis and quality checks.

## Current Repository Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Working directory status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Staged changes: !`git diff --staged --stat`
- Unstaged changes: !`git diff --stat`
- Recent commits on current branch: !`git log --oneline main..HEAD`

## PR Creation Workflow

Think about the changes you've made and follow this systematic approach to create a high-quality Pull Request.

### Step 1: Analyze and Prepare Changes

#### 1.1 Review Current Changes
```bash
# Review uncommitted changes
git diff

# Review staged changes  
git diff --staged

# Check which files have been modified
git status
```

#### 1.2 Ensure Changes are Ready
```bash
# Stage all changes if needed
git add .

# Create meaningful commit if changes are uncommitted
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  git commit -m "feat: $ARGUMENTS

- Implement core functionality
- Add comprehensive tests
- Update documentation

Addresses related issue requirements"
fi

# Ensure branch is up to date with main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Push current branch
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### Step 2: Quality Verification

#### 2.1 Run Comprehensive Checks
```bash
# Run all quality checks
echo "üß™ Running tests..."
bun run test

echo "üîç Type checking..."
bun run type-check  

echo "‚ú® Code quality checks..."
bun run check

echo "üé® Auto-formatting..."
bun run check:write

echo "üîß Build verification..."
bun run build || echo "Build check skipped (no build script)"
```

#### 2.2 Verify No Issues
If any checks fail, address them before proceeding:
```bash
# Fix any formatting issues
bun run check:write

# Address test failures
# Fix type errors  
# Resolve linting issues
```

### Step 3: Create Pull Request

#### 3.1 Auto-Generate PR (Recommended)
```bash
# Let GitHub CLI generate title and description from commits
gh pr create --fill
```

#### 3.2 Custom PR with Template
```bash
# Create with custom title and structured template
gh pr create \
  --title "$ARGUMENTS" \
  --template .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md
```

#### 3.3 Manual PR Creation (Advanced)
```bash
# Create PR with comprehensive manual description
gh pr create \
  --title "$ARGUMENTS" \
  --body "$(cat << 'EOF'

### Step 4: Enhance PR Metadata

#### 4.1 Add Metadata and Context
```bash
# Get the PR number
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')

gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --add-assignee @me

# Add relevant labels based on change type
echo "Select appropriate labels:"
echo "1. bug - Bug fix"
echo "2. enhancement - New feature"
echo "3. documentation - Documentation update" 
echo "4. refactor - Code refactoring"
echo "5. performance - Performance improvement"

# Example: Add enhancement label
gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --add-label "enhancement"

# Add reviewers if known
# gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --add-reviewer "teammate1,teammate2"

# Add to project/milestone if applicable
# gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --add-project "Project Name"
# gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --milestone "v1.2.0"
```

#### 4.2 Link to Related Issues
```bash
# If this PR addresses specific issues, link them
# gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --body "$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json body --jq '.body')

# Fixes #123

## Best Practices

### PR Quality Guidelines
- **Atomic changes**: Each PR should address one logical change
- **Clear communication**: Title and description should be self-explanatory
- **Comprehensive testing**: Include both automated and manual testing
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with your changes
- **Backward compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes when possible

### Code Review Preparation
- **Self-review first**: Review your own changes critically
- **Clean history**: Ensure commit messages are clear and logical
- **Remove debugging code**: Clean up any temporary or debug code
- **Test edge cases**: Verify your changes handle edge cases properly

### Collaboration Tips
- **Respond promptly**: Address review feedback quickly
- **Be descriptive**: Explain complex decisions in comments
- **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification
- **Learn from feedback**: Use reviews as learning opportunities

Think carefully about your changes and ensure they meet the project's quality standards before creating the PR. A well-prepared PR saves time for everyone involved in the review process.
